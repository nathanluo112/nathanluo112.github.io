**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I have a very clear understanding of the difference between padding, margin and borders. Padding is the space between the edge of the element to the content of the element, border is the interface between the element and its exterior, margin is the space between elements. When adding the "debug" property to the elements, I can clearly see the element's property and position.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
Positioning can be very complicated. We have to determine which mode to use so it will react differently as we change the screen size. Static, relative, absolute and fixed are the 4 different modes for the position property.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
For me the whole site is very complicated, exspecially positioning the 4 different blocks of contents. The sidebar is relatively easier compare to other parts.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I was following the atomic practice to code the css and html files and found it very clear and useful, though positioning is always the hard part. It would be a lot easier as we start using the grid scheme.
