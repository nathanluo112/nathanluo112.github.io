          My hometown is Guangzhou, China, a beautiful city with thousands of years of history. I have always been proud of my city for its scene, its people, its culture. I came to Columbus Ohio in 2008. The quiet and peaceful atmosphere captured me in a blink. Soon after, I started my college education in Ohio State University. That's the most enlightening experience I have had. The sparks of ideas, the urge of creation all rushed in as I moved forward gradually, and the feeling of freedom that I had never experience before planted a seed which lead me here today.

          I am always a fan of comedy. Any kind of comedy shows will catch my eyes. Among all of them, the Daily Show is the one that gives me the most thoughts on the society and the culture. Also watching stand-up comedy show is one of my favourite event. I should go to a live show someday.

          I started my professional career working with one of the alumni and manage the US warehouse for the company. That's one of the most intense and exciting experience I've ever had. Logistics, processing line design, budgeting, system maintenance, infrastructre construction, HR, internal-external communication, taxing, company law, etc. All those tasks came in a so compact manner that in one way stressed me a lot, but in another way gave me so much knowledge in a very short time.

          Of all the new things I have learned, my favorite topic is resource management. I spent a long time on our still-in-development ERP. The amount of data and resources are so immense but lacking utility. The gradually improving ERP helped to monitor, save, and analyze different kinds of resource for better efficiency. Since the growth of our company is about 70% per year, the company is in constantly needs of new procedure and development projects. As a result our ERP needs constant updates on different modules to expand its capability. I had countless challenges and exciting moments when designing and implementing the physical procedure and transfer the procedure to the ERP.

          This kind of excitement is exactly what I was looking for. I am looking for skills to build something that can help us as a whole. So here I am in the NYC campus of Dev Bootcamp.
