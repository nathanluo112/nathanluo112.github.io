          My hometown is Guangzhou, China, a beautiful city with a thousand years of history. I have always been proud of my city for its scene, its people, and its culture. I came to Columbus Ohio in 2008. The quiet and peaceful atmosphere captured me in a blink. Soon after, I started my college education in Ohio State University. That's the most enlightening experience I have throughout my life. The spark of ideas, the urge of creation all rushed in as I moved forward gradually, and the feeling of freedom that I had never experience before planted a seed which lead me here today.

          I majored in Computer Engineering, specifying DSP and low level programming. Though because of my identity (not citizen), it's a bit hard to look for a job at that field. Eventually I started working with one of the alumni and manage the US warehouse for the company. That's one of the most intense and exciting experience I've ever had. Processing line design, budgeting, system maintenance, infrastructre construction, HR, internal-external communication, etc. All those tasks came in a so compact manner that in one way stressed me a lot, but in another way gave me so much knowledge in a very short time. I am very thankful for that experience.

          I am always a fan of comedy. Any kind of comedy shows will catch my eyes. Among all of them, the Daily Show is the one that gives me the most thoughts on the society and the culture. Also watching stand-up comedy show is one of my favourite event. I should go to a live show someday.

          Video game is also one my passions. Though I was too lazy to play the game myself. I spend more time on watching other's playthrough than actually playing it. It is always very exciting to experience different worlds and stories.
