        As we are moving more and more into the cloud, most of our activity and information will be sent online. All the "smart" devices, leading by smartphone, and recently smart-watches, then lately smart-thermolstat, smart-fridge, smart-crock pot, smart-coffee-maker etc came to the market. All of these "smart" device have some connection to the internet to allow the user to control them remotely using their "smart" phone. That means a lot of information is being sent to the internet for you to access. That doesn't mean you are the only one see your own information. As the information is sent online, they are stored in the corporate servers, and how they use the data is not disclosed to you, the end user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here comes the new meaning to online security. Before it was about protecting personal data in our own computer from being hacked by cyber thefts, or data encryption for security data transmission. Nowadays, we share our data willingly for more cloud integration, more convenience. Is it a even trade between convenience and private information? That up to the users to determine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we have a smart-crock pot that allows you to cook your dinner while on the way home. On you smartphone, there is an app that allow you to remote control when the crock pot will start cooking the food you put in for defroze this morning. You press the button, the crock pot start cooking. The signal sent from your smartphone to your smart-crock pot via internet can tell the smart-crock pot what to do, but also it contains the information that your house is empty until a while later, or your working schedule. No one knows how the companies will use this kind of information, and even though they won't abuse the data, there is a chance the corporate server will be hacked and all the data will be stolen. Since the data being sent out is no controllable any more, you still have a choice of not sending the information at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, you have to compare the conveniences the smart-crock pot provides and the risk of your personal habit being compromise.
