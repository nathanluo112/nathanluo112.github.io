      The video really open up the seal for me. The consumer mindset is so profound and subtle that I have never thought about it until I watched the video. Indeed we have been trained to think in terms of a customer. But in terms of DBC, this might not be the best practice after all. It is great to think about that before the bootcamp started. We are not just learning a language, or industry practice. More importantly, we are learning the way we have communication, collaboration, and contribution. DBC can provide a building ground but the actual accomplishment may comes in years later. It is so important to build up mindset, habits and behaviors and so far, this concept is very well embedded in the challenges and the overall curriculum. Chefs' mindset being we will be the one bring the products to the table, and indeed that's what going to happen. We are the one determining what we will learn and bring that we learn into our future.
