<!--
*How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair
  It was very pleasant to work through this section with a pair. I can learn from my pair's thought process and re-evaluate my original design. While writing up the HTML, we collaborate on the syntax and conventions since we have the wireframes as the building block already. In time there is some misunderstanding and disagreement, but all of them are resolved as we research and discuss in detail.

*Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing is very helpful since we have a building block to work on the HTML file. It clearly outline the structure of the HTML file to speed up the implementation process. Without it would be very hard to implement the page, and it would be impossible to work without it in some more complex web pages.

*What did you and your pair decide make a good wireframe?
  We are trying to keep it simple and clear. Since we don't have much formatting skills yet, we can only focus on the strutual apparence. With a simple and clear wireframe, we can struture the content in a more systematic manner.

*What new semantic element did you learn about (if any)?
  I learnt about the aside and nav tag. Aside tag will be used on the list for quick post navigation on the side. Nav tag is simply a navigation bar on top of the page for links to different pages.
