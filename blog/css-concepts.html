            Once you open a website, what catches you eyes the first? The content? The author? Probably not. The site's overall appearance, the color, the graphical design are probably the elements draws your attention the first. Everything will have a first impression insert to our thought, and that impression will affect our actions afterward. In terms of website browsing, users are very straighforward: they will continue to use the site if it is pleasant to use it. So today's website mostly use User Experience as their design direction. Positioning the elements in the website is one of the most challenging but effectient phases in website design.

            CSS provide us several useful positioning modes to change the appearance of the elements in HTML. Even though they are the building block of structuring websites, they are not extremely user-friendly.
            When we are looking at a html element, we should expand the view into its relatives: the browser page, the adjacent elements, the parent elements, etc. Position of the elements can be changed according to its relationship between other elements, or can be fixed in a spot on the screen. CSS's position property provides these extensive functionality by four different modes: Static, Relative, Absolute and Fixed. I was confused when I first encounter these modes but after some practice, it becomes self-explanitory.

            Static is the default element positioning mode, that is if you don't specifically change the element's mode by using the "Position" property in CSS, it will be in static mode. Noted that this mode has a concept of "normal" position, which is where the element will appear as it naturally flow in.

            Relative can be very confusing, as it is relative to its own "normal" position. This is why the relationship between its parent and direct sibling elements also need to be considered. After you know its normal position, it would be easier to change the location accordingly using relative mode, for example shift right/left for a certain amount of pixels.

            Absolute is quite a strong mode as it place the element irrelevant to other elements. All of the relationship between the elements as mentioned above won't have any affect on the element with this mode. Any position you set it at will not affect this or other elements behavior.

            Lastly, Fixed mode is very useful and common as it stays at the position of the browser window and won't be affected if the window is scroll up or down. A lot of ads you see nowadays uses this mode you can never unsee it.

            All these explanation makes no sense without actual practicing. So it would be great to see more samples and try it yourself. W3School is a very powerful site for hands-on example and practice problem. Definitely should check that out.

*How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair
  It was very pleasant to work through this section with a pair. I can learn from my pair's thought process and re-evaluate my original design. While writing up the HTML, we collaborate on the syntax and conventions since we have the wireframes as the building block already. In time there is some misunderstanding and disagreement, but all of them are resolved as we research and discuss in detail.

*Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing is very helpful since we have a building block to work on the HTML file. It clearly outline the structure of the HTML file to speed up the implementation process. Without it would be very hard to implement the page, and it would be impossible to work without it in some more complex web pages.

*What did you and your pair decide make a good wireframe?
  We are trying to keep it simple and clear. Since we don't have much formatting skills yet, we can only focus on the strutual apparence. With a simple and clear wireframe, we can struture the content in a more systematic manner.

*What new semantic element did you learn about (if any)?
  I learnt about the aside and nav tag. Aside tag will be used on the list for quick post navigation on the side. Nav tag is simply a navigation bar on top of the page for links to different pages.
