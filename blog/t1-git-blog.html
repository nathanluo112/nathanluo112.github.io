      Git  have always been a really fancy word for me. The main reason being I have no idea what it actually means, nor I ever had the urge to learn about it. Everything changes as I start a developer course at DevBootcamp. First thing I was taught in this bootcamp is the importance of version control and then Git along with GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control, instead of what how the general idea perceive that being the action of controlling the published version or systematically naming the version, in the developer's perspective, it is a practice with a much more micro scale. It is actually an idea of monitoring change of the project. Each change of the project is a new version: file content edition, file addition, removal, or peripheral addition and removal. This kind of concept becomes more important as the scale of the project as well as the collaboration increases. When there are multiple developers working on the same project, which is the general scenario, tracking changes is so vital in order to have a clean, efficient collabration environment. This is where Git comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is in fact a version control program. The main idea is there is a master/original copy of the project. And new edition to the project will be added to a branched out copy, then push back to the master copy after all the changes are made and tested. All of the changes will be store in a log for future referencing. This is very helpful for collaboration because each "push" has some detail information about what was changed and who made the changes along with some messages the author put up. This requires the author follow the general messaging scheme to ease the referencing in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then what is GitHub? Consider the difference between a flashdrive and Dropbox. Both of them are ways for storage, while one is your physical local drive and the other one is an online storage drive. This is a very similar scenario with Git and GitHub. Git store all of the data/project in your local machine, while GitHub is an online host. The advantage of GitHub is very clear: as long as you have Internet, you can download the complete project and collaborate on the project whenever or wherever. Of coures there are lots of details and technique of using Git and GitHub but this is the general idea.

*How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair
  It was very pleasant to work through this section with a pair. I can learn from my pair's thought process and re-evaluate my original design. While writing up the HTML, we collaborate on the syntax and conventions since we have the wireframes as the building block already. In time there is some misunderstanding and disagreement, but all of them are resolved as we research and discuss in detail.

*Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing is very helpful since we have a building block to work on the HTML file. It clearly outline the structure of the HTML file to speed up the implementation process. Without it would be very hard to implement the page, and it would be impossible to work without it in some more complex web pages.

*What did you and your pair decide make a good wireframe?
  We are trying to keep it simple and clear. Since we don't have much formatting skills yet, we can only focus on the strutual apparence. With a simple and clear wireframe, we can struture the content in a more systematic manner.

*What new semantic element did you learn about (if any)?
  I learnt about the aside and nav tag. Aside tag will be used on the list for quick post navigation on the side. Nav tag is simply a navigation bar on top of the page for links to different pages.
